                limited to: increased velocity, better code, fast/flexible builds, hatred of Scala, impatience
                with Java, psoriasis, pregnancy, hot flashes, delusions of grandeur, dynamic code reloading,
                diabetes, ast transformations, dizziness, redness, headache, and dry mouth. Always consult your
                doctor, counselor, minister, priest, rabbi, or the nearest cetacean biologist before moving to Groovy
                or any other new technology.

              <h3 style="text-align: center;">#1: Java Was Too Fat</h3>
              <ul style="font-size: 70%">
                <li>The year is 2007, and fat Java web frameworks ruled the land. People had just started talking
                  about Ajax (remember that?).</li>
                <li>3+ year investment In Java, which was itself a re-write of code written in 2001 (ported from classic ASP/VB).</li>
                <li>This was my first large Java project but I had hit a wall, I was spending all of my time fixing bugs
                  and very little time developing new features.
                </li>
                <li>I tried a few of the cool frameworks at the time but found they didn't help much, they mainly just required
                  that I write different kinds of boilerplate code.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 style="text-align: center;">#1: Go On A Groovy Diet</h3>
              <ul style="font-size: 70%">
                <li>The main problem was Java. String handling sucked, RegEx support was complicated,
                  type information made it hard to evolve the code, testing in Java was painful, ClassCastExceptions
                  were common, verbose code etc.
                <li>Switching to Groovy gave me instant relief to all of these problems because I was able to evolve my code
                  piecemeal...and this was before joint compilation</li>
                <li>Every time I refactored from Java -> Groovy code size would decrease a factor of between two and five</li>
                <li>This was the peak of Rails hype, but before Grails hit 1.0. I was tempted to jump to Rails, but
                  knew that it would be a complete re-write that would take 6 months...and I didn't have 6 months to spare</li>
                <li>Got back on track. Would develop for several more years and left when it became clear that
                  there wasn't anything left to do</li>
              </ul>

              <ul style="font-size: 70%">
                <li>Groovy dynamicity was abused, hurt by static type checking</li>
                <li>People unwisely using Groovy features, such as closures, just because they could</li>
                <li>Hard time upgrading off of Grails 1.x</li>
                <li>Bad performance, though at this company nothing is ever performant enough</li>

              <ul style="font-size: 70%">
                <li>Every system performs well in different ways: optimize the right thing</li>
                <li>Big data project that had to churn through terabytes of data in under 5 seconds</li>
                <li>Data stored in a columnar store that was highly dependent on submitting the correct
                  queries, select * from x; was NEVER the right answer</li>
                <li>The queries were highly dynamic and had to be customized for each installation</li>
                <li>Make a Groovy DSL, spend a few more microseconds generating the queries, then
                  save several minutes in server side processing</li>

                <li>System supported 4 out of 24 possible network decoders</li>
                <li>No JVM library supported all 24 decoders</li>
                <li>Most didn't support full decodes, they were ad-hoc and partial</li>
                <li>Speed was a constant issue. Flexibility always led to slower code</li>

              <ul style="font-size: 70%">
                <li>Groovy can perform well, sometimes even better than Java</li>
                <li>I offered to implement all 24 decoders, support all fields,
                  provide a flexible plugin system to support all extensions, have it
                  perform better than all previous JVM based decoders, and to do it a couple of months</li>
                <li>We delivered on all counts.</li>
                <li>Because Groovy</li>
                <li>@CompileStatic + AST Transformations allowed us to implement a compile time
                  DSL. Implementing the decoders was literally copying the spec out of pdf files and
                  massaging them a little inside Groovy files</li>
                <li>Compile Time DSL also allowed custom code to be added at compile time, lazy or eager
                  decoding with no additional code, and accessing of data as Maps or properties.</li>

              <ul style="font-size: 70%">
                <li>Extremely brittle deployments, especially in DB changes.</li>
                <li>On deploy day people brought their PL/SQL scripts, threw them in a pile, and expected the DBAs to sort them out</li>
                <li>Script runs were sequence dependent</li>
                <li>Needed different scripts to run in different environments</li>
                <li>Oh yeah, solution better just be plain PL/SQL scripts so DBAs can examine them</li>

              <ul style="font-size: 70%">
                <li>Ordering dependencies should always suggest a build tool, that's what they are good at.</li>
                <li>Solution: Custom gradle plugin written in Groovy</li>
                <li>Built custom deployer on top of Gradle application plugin and using Flyway</li>
                <li>DBAs still don't know what the guts are made of because they just see
                  a zip file that contains a bat file and some PL/SQL scripts.</li>
                <li>It contains other stuff too, but I don't point that out.</li>

              <ul style="font-size: 70%">
                <li>Extremely mission critical app crashes for long periods of time</li>
                <li>Simple re-boots are risky and in general do not help because the app
                  is processing data real time, it just goes back to crashing.</li>
                <li>Written in Java with lots of custom Neo4j extensions</li>
                <li>When it was working correctly it took around 0.5 seconds
                  to match a person to a survey, under bad conditions up to 5 seconds,
                  under really bad conditions it would never return.</li>

                <li>Realize that Neo4j was the incorrect choice for this project
                  and that it was mainly being used to analyze complex expressions</li>
                <li>Implement custom expression DSL and an efficient
                  in memory representation of the data, both in Groovy</li>
                <li>Optimized datat access access layer written in Groovy (Duh!).</li>
                <li>Completely replace system. Response times drop to 20 ms. Can exhaustively

                <li>Application that computes person's data points is very critical</li>
                <li>Written in Scala so computational algorithm starts out immutable</li>
                <li>Eventually part of the code is written in a mutable style either for
                  efficiency or because it was the only way people could get it done</li>
                <li>Computes state in around 10 ms per person. While that sounds fast,
                  how long to compute state for 6.5 million + people?</li>
                <li>Real problem is the amount of garbage generated under heavy load

                <li>I want to be clear: Immutability is usually a clear win, I use
                  <em>final</em> more than anyone I know</li>
                <li>You will eventually have to mutate state, plan for this up
                  front and do it intelligently</li>
                <li>Solution: Yep, re-write in Groovy</li>
                <li>New solution is probably <em>more</em> immutable than the previous solution,
                  but we mutate when speed counts, which is accessing a very efficient primitives based Map</li>
                <li>We changed the original tree based algorithm to a DAG based algorithm</li>
                <li>Computes state in around 0.2 ms per person and generates ZERO garbage</li>

              <ul style="font-size: 70%">
                <li>Be as specific as possible in understanding the problem</li>
                <li>Take as much time as you need for this step. Think a lot and
                  engage in HDD, Hammock Driven Development. Get philosophical
                  and computer sciencey</li>
                <li><b>Bad Example:</b> We have too much unreadable code</li>
                <li><b>Good Example:</b> We have too much unreadable code because we have
                  implemented an ad-hoc interpreter for our configuration system.
                  We need the ability to compile and execute code at runtime using
                  a real language.</li>
                <li><b>Bad Example:</b> We have too much unreadable code</li>
                <li><b>Good Example:</b> Our code is unreadable because we have no unified
                  and compact way of specifying the business logic. We need to pull
                  the logic together into a DSL that clearly expresses what the business
                  does, ideally in a single file. Even better if we can use that
                  single file to produce a visual representation of business logic.</li>

            <section>
              Now that you have identified the problem, it's time to match the tool you
              want to use to the identified problem. This rarely is going to be a formal pitch,
              I've only done that a single time. If the problem you are solving is real, causes pain,
              slows things down, and/or costs money people are usually pretty reasonable
              about possible solutions.

                <li>No organization is a blank slate. Knowing how you got here helps
                  you to tailor the pitch and avoid re-treading the same ground</li>
                <li>The quickest way to get shot down is when your boss
                  says <em>We already tried that</em>. There usually isn't a way to come
                  back from that unless you can show <em>No we didn't try that</em>.
                <li>Talk to people and listen to their war stories in the org. It builds
                  camraderie, shows you care, and gives you valuable insights into history</li>
                <li>Source code control systems are a valuable source of history</li>
                <li>Don't just talk to developers. Also talk to managers (they were often developers),
                  production control/dev ops, QA engineers, DBAs, and anyone else who knows something.</li>
